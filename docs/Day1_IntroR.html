# Expectations

---

# We're not pointing or clicking

- We will be writing code in this class
    - Succint instructions to the computer to do things
    - R will be our __language__ of choice in doing this
- This is sort of old school
    - No point-and-click when I started in the late 90s
    - But it's very effective once you learn it

---

# We're not pointing or clicking

- I don't expect you to learn all the details in 3 days
  - But I'll give you resources to learn more
  - And point to where you might get questions answered
- It won't all be simple
  - I want you to be able to __use__ R
  - Sometimes that means learning some more advanced material
  - I'll go slow with it, and try to get the mental model to you
  
---

# A practical view

- This will not be a geeky computer science class
- This will be a modest refresher on statistics
  - If you hated stats before, maybe I'll change your mind
  - If you actually learned stats before, maybe I'll give you a fresh view
- This will be about 
  - learning good enough practices
  - making analyses reproducible
  - creating complete products
    - raw data to reports

---

# A modern view

- I'll keep things as current as I can
  - R has evolved a lot in 20 years
- Maybe some of it will even excite you
  - Interactive graphics
  - Reproducible and repeatable reports
  - Mistake-free data-driven presentations
  - Cutting edge analyses
  - Supportive community
  
---

# Workshop format

- Mostly expository
- Some hands-on
- Use your post-its and stickers to get my attention
- Use post-its for questions/comments
- Ask questions if you're confused
